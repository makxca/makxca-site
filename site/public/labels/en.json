  "siteIdea": "The idea of&nbsp;this site is&nbsp;to&nbsp;try all possible technologies with which websites can be&nbsp;developed and deployed (and, possibly in&nbsp;future, tested). Look in&nbsp;the menu at&nbsp;the top left of&nbsp;the screen for other technologies with which this site was developed&nbsp;&mdash; I&nbsp;hope, you will find it&nbsp;interesting.",

  "deploymentTechnologyDescription": "[Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) are used to&nbsp;deploy the site. Individual backends, which are used to&nbsp;serve parts of&nbsp;the site, are put inside a&nbsp;Docker container, then the container is&nbsp;uploaded to&nbsp;the Docker Hub, and the link to&nbsp;the image is&nbsp;added to&nbsp;the Kubernetes configuration. The server hosting Kubernetes is&nbsp;hosted in&nbsp;[Yandex Cloud](https://yandex.cloud). The domain was purchased on&nbsp;[reg.ru](https://reg.ru).\n\nThere are plans to&nbsp;use GitHub Actions to&nbsp;make releases easier.",

It&nbsp;inspires me&nbsp;to&nbsp;design and develop websites and servers, because I&nbsp;know that real people will use it.\n\nIn my&nbsp;free time, I&rsquo;m a&nbsp;mountaineer and a&nbsp;guitarist :)\n\nYou can find more of&nbsp;my&nbsp;projects on&nbsp;[GitHub](https://github.com/makxca)"
